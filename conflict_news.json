The move underscores the ongoing debate within Germany and among its allies regarding the provision of increasingly sophisticated weaponry to Ukraine as it defends itself against Russian aggression. This decision is a critical juncture in the conflict, as long-range missiles could significantly alter the strategic landscape and Ukraine's ability to strike deeper into Russian-held territory. The implications of this support could escalate the conflict.",
