This demand underscores the deep mistrust between Hamas and involved parties, including mediators like Qatar and Egypt, and signals a reluctance to accept temporary pauses without long-term security guarantees. The demand comes amidst international pressure to finalize a deal that would halt the fighting and facilitate the release of hostages, reflecting the complex dynamics and high stakes of the negotiations. The resolution of these negotiations will likely determine the future trajectory of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict and stability in the region."
