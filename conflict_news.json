    "summary": "Following the election of Donald Trump and amidst the ongoing war in Ukraine, ordinary Poles are increasingly preparing for a potential Russian invasion. Concerned about Moscow's potential actions, civilians are taking matters into their own hands, with many participating in civilian defense training, including learning combat skills and survival techniques. This reflects a growing sense of vulnerability and distrust of external security guarantees, particularly fueled by perceived shifts in geopolitical dynamics. The Polish government and various private organizations are key players in facilitating these preparations, underscoring a national focus on readiness and resilience against potential aggression.",

    "text": "Russia lacks any formal, organized effort to account for legions of missing soldiers. That often leaves relatives in limbo, fending for themselves with scant government information.",

    "source": "NYT",
    "summary": "Russia's ongoing military operations, particularly in Ukraine, have resulted in a significant number of missing soldiers, a situation exacerbated by the absence of a formal system for accounting for them. This vacuum leaves families to independently seek information, relying on limited government support and sparse updates regarding their loved ones' whereabouts. The Kremlin, while engaged in these military campaigns, has not established an effective mechanism for identifying and communicating with families of missing personnel. This lack of transparency and accountability underscores the human cost of the conflict and deepens the suffering of those impacted by the ongoing hostilities."

    "summary": "In March, the Israeli military's killing of 15 medics and first responders in Gaza, initially justified as a response to an immediate threat, is now being questioned. Eyewitness accounts, video analysis, and autopsy reports reveal that multiple soldiers fired at unarmed emergency workers over a six-minute period, casting doubt on the official explanation. This incident, occurring amidst the ongoing conflict in Gaza, raises serious concerns about the targeting of humanitarian workers and the potential for violations of international law. The findings necessitate further investigation to determine accountability and uphold humanitarian principles during armed conflict."
