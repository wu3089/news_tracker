    "summary": "Amidst the growing humanitarian crisis in Gaza, local men are reportedly exploiting vulnerable women by offering food, money, or work in exchange for sexual interactions. These allegations highlight the desperation and protection risks faced by women in Gaza, exacerbated by the ongoing conflict and aid shortages. The United Nations and other humanitarian organizations are aware of the reports, with figures such as Juliette Touma from UNRWA acknowledging heightened protection concerns, yet the full scale of the exploitation remains difficult to ascertain due to the sensitivity of the issue and fear of reprisal. This exploitation compounds the existing challenges of displacement, food insecurity, and lack of access to essential services confronting Gazan women during the Israel-Hamas war."
