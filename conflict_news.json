    "summary": "Hundreds of Israeli ex-officials appealed to Donald Trump to intervene and help end the ongoing Gaza war, signaling internal disagreement within Israel regarding the conflict's continuation.

    "summary": "A powerful earthquake near the Kamchatka peninsula last week posed a potential, though likely limited, threat to Russia's Rybachiy base. The Rybachiy base houses nuclear-powered submarines from Russia's Pacific Fleet, raising concerns about the safety and operational readiness of these vital strategic assets. While the base lies approximately 80 miles from the epicenter, Russian authorities have not reported any damage, so operations are assumed to remain unaffected. This seismic event highlights the vulnerability of critical infrastructure in geographically active regions and compels Russia to consider natural disaster mitigation in its Pacific Fleet strategy."

    "summary": "The United States accuses Russia of violating the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces (INF) Treaty for over a decade, highlighting a breakdown in arms control agreements. This accusation, made after the treaty's 2019 expiration, underscores longstanding tensions between Washington and Moscow regarding compliance with international security pacts. Russia's alleged violations, although not newly revealed, contribute to a deteriorating security environment marked by mistrust and a renewed focus on strategic competition between the two nations. The INF Treaty, originally signed in 1987, prohibited ground-launched ballistic and cruise missiles with ranges of 500 to 5,500 kilometers, aiming to reduce the threat of nuclear conflict in Europe."
