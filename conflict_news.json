    "summary": "Following a week of attacks, Port Sudan is reeling from a series of bombardments, a stark contrast to its prior relative safety from the broader civil war. While the article does not explicitly name specific actors, the attacks demonstrate the conflict's expansion, potentially affecting the strategic importance of Port Sudan, which is a major port. The attacks, leaving the city without water or power, underscore the devastating impact of the ongoing conflict on civilian populations and infrastructure.",
