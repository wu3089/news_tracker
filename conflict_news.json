    "summary": "The Israeli navy struck the Houthi-controlled port city of Hudaydah in Yemen, marking an escalation of the conflict. This action follows repeated missile launches by the Houthis targeting Israel in solidarity with Gaza. Israel views these Houthi attacks as a threat to its national security and maritime interests. The Houthis, a Zaidi Shia Muslim group, control much of Yemen and have been engaged in a civil war since 2014, further destabilizing the region.",

    "summary": "Transcarpathia, a region in western Ukraine, remains relatively untouched by the direct conflict with Russia, unlike many eastern regions of the country. This isolation from the war shapes local experiences and perspectives, differentiating them from Ukrainians directly impacted by Russian aggression. As such, the Ukrainian government faces the task of creating a unified national identity across regions with drastically different war experiences. The unique circumstances in Transcarpathia highlight the uneven impact of the conflict and complicate efforts to foster national cohesion amid the ongoing war."
