    "date_str": "February 20, 2025",
    "summary": "President Donald Trump recently made statements appearing to blame Ukraine for responsibility in the ongoing war with Russia. This contradicts the widely recognized aggression and invasion of Ukraine by Russian forces. The tensions between Ukraine and Russia have a long and complex history, involving territorial disputes, political differences, and external influences. Ukraine gained independence from the Soviet Union in 1991, and tensions with Russia have escalated in recent years, particularly after Russia's annexation of Crimea in 2014. The ongoing war has resulted in significant casualties and displacement of people in Ukraine, with international efforts focused on finding a peaceful resolution.",
