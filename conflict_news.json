    "summary": "Reports indicate that numerous Ukrainian women have endured rape and other forms of sexual violence at the hands of Russian soldiers, a practice contributing to the human cost of the ongoing conflict. These victims have largely remained silent due to the social stigma and fear of retaliation, which has previously hindered the collection of evidence. However, the silence is beginning to fracture as international organizations and Ukrainian authorities increase their efforts to document and address the widespread sexual violence, reflecting a growing determination to hold perpetrators accountable. This shift coincides with mounting evidence of human rights abuses committed by Russian forces since the invasion began."
