    "summary": "Israel continues to detain at least 200 Palestinians suspected of participating in the 2023 Hamas-led attacks, underscoring the country's commitment to accountability in the wake of the assault. Despite holding these individuals, Israeli authorities have not yet charged or initiated trials against any of them, raising concerns about due process. This situation unfolds against the backdrop of heightened tensions between Israel and Palestinian militant groups, particularly Hamas, and influences international perceptions of Israel's security measures and legal practices in the ongoing conflict. The lack of charges and trials will likely draw scrutiny from human rights organizations and international legal bodies."
