    "summary": "Despite ongoing international efforts, the prospect of a lasting ceasefire remains distant and improbable for soldiers and commanders engaged in active combat. This sentiment highlights the challenges in resolving conflicts where parties are deeply entrenched and distrustful of negotiated settlements. The reported views suggest that while diplomatic discussions may be underway, the realities faced by frontline personnel underscore the persistent obstacles to achieving a sustainable peace. The absence of a shared vision for a ceasefire among those most directly affected threatens to undermine any potential agreements."
