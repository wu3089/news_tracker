    "summary": "The UN reimposed sanctions on Iran, a move that further constrains the nation's economy and exacerbates hardships for Iranian citizens. These sanctions, which several Security Council members dispute as illegitimate, compound existing economic pressures, leaving many Iranians struggling to afford basic necessities. The reimposition occurs amid escalating regional tensions involving Iran, the United States, and Israel, particularly following the deaths of Iranian-backed Hezbollah leaders in Israeli airstrikes. This action underscores the ongoing international efforts to curb Iran's nuclear program and regional influence, even as the country faces increased economic vulnerability and societal anxiety."

While making this declaration, Lavrov simultaneously criticized Western countries and Israel, highlighting Russia's continued grievances with the existing international order. These statements come against the backdrop of the war in Ukraine, where NATO support for Kyiv has significantly strained relations between Russia and the West, raising concerns about potential escalation. Despite Lavrov's assurances, skepticism persists given Russia's recent military actions and increasingly confrontational rhetoric. Therefore, analysts will scrutinize Russia's actions to determine whether they align with Lavrov's stated intent.",
