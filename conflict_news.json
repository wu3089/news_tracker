    "summary": "According to internal Vietnamese documents, Russia and Vietnam are circumventing potential U.S. sanctions on arms deals by using profits from joint energy ventures to finance defense contracts. This arrangement allows Vietnam to continue purchasing Russian arms, a key source for its military, without direct financial transfers that could trigger penalties. The scheme highlights the ongoing strategic partnership between Russia, led by Vladimir Putin, and Vietnam, currently under President To Lam, despite increasing pressure from the U.S. to isolate Russia. This financial mechanism underscores the challenges in enforcing sanctions and the continued efforts by some nations to maintain ties with Russia amid geopolitical tensions. The AP obtained the documents."

This offensive, launched in response to previous Hamas attacks, represents a major escalation in the conflict and aims to degrade Hamas' military capabilities. The success of this operation hinges on the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) ability to neutralize Hamas fighters and infrastructure within the densely populated urban environment. A decisive Israeli victory in Gaza City could alter the balance of power in the region and potentially pave the way for future negotiations."
