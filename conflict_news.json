    "summary": "At a \"Patriotic Festival\" near Moscow, Russia, the BBC gauged Russian sentiment on the war in Ukraine, finding that a key message promoted is the idea of Russian victory. The Russian government, along with media outlets, have consistently framed the conflict in this way, which likely influences public perception. This messaging occurs against the backdrop of ongoing military operations and international sanctions, and shapes how Russians perceive the war's potential outcomes and Russia's role in the conflict. Understanding these perspectives is crucial for analyzing the domestic implications of the war within Russia and its potential impact on the broader geopolitical landscape.",
