The conflicting accounts highlight the difficulty in verifying events on the ground and the growing international pressure for a ceasefire. These circumstances, if confirmed, would likely intensify scrutiny of the IDF's rules of engagement and further complicate efforts to deliver crucial assistance to Palestinian civilians.",
