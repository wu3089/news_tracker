    "summary": "Amidst the ongoing conflict, journalists in Gaza operate under perilous conditions to report on events, facing the risk of becoming targets themselves. Following an Israeli strike, journalist Ibrahim Qannan commenced a live broadcast, highlighting the dangers reporters encounter while covering the conflict. The broader context involves the Israel-Hamas conflict, where journalists like Wael Dahdouh, who lost his son Hamza (also a journalist) in an airstrike, exemplify the sacrifices made to document the situation. News organizations and individual reporters navigate these challenges to provide coverage of the conflict's impact on the Gaza Strip."

    "text": "President Trump said a Russian proposal to extend by one year the limits on long-range nuclear weapons sounded “like a good idea to me.”",
    "link": "https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/06/world/europe/russia-trump-putin-nuclear-caps.html",
    "date_str": "October 06, 2025",
    "source": "NYT",
    "summary": "President Trump expressed interest in a Russian proposal to extend the New START treaty by one year, a move that could temporarily maintain constraints on the world’s two largest nuclear arsenals. This response follows Moscow's public offer and comes amidst long-standing U.S. efforts to include China in future arms control agreements, a condition Russia opposes. The New START treaty, set to expire in February 2021, limits the number of deployed nuclear warheads and delivery systems for both the United States and Russia, and its potential lapse raises concerns about a renewed nuclear arms race. Trump's positive reaction indicates a possible shift in U.S. negotiating strategy regarding nuclear arms control with Russia."
