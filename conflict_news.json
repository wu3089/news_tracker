    "text": "Russian forces launched 100 attack drones across Ukraine overnight, hours after President Vladimir V. Putin ordered a unilateral three-day cease-fire starting on May 8.",
    "link": "https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/29/world/europe/ukraine-russia-zelensky-putin-truce.html",
    "date_str": "April 29, 2025",
    "source": "NYT",
    "summary": "Following Russian President Vladimir Putin's announcement of a unilateral three-day cease-fire in Ukraine, Russian forces deployed approximately 100 attack drones throughout the country overnight. This action undermines the credibility of Russia's declared truce and signals a continued aggressive posture despite the proclaimed cessation of hostilities. The drone attacks, which occurred hours after the cease-fire was to begin, demonstrate Russia's commitment to pursuing its military objectives in Ukraine through ongoing offensive operations. This latest development underscores the complexities of the conflict and raises further concerns about the prospects for a negotiated settlement."
