This policy change triggers anger within the ultra-Orthodox community, whose political parties are crucial to Netanyahu's fragile government, potentially destabilizing the existing political order. The long-standing exemptions and the subsequent draft orders place immense pressure on the government and the delicate balance within Israeli society."
