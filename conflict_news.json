This latest development significantly weakens the Sudanese Armed Forces (SAF) and endangers civilians in a region already facing a dire humanitarian crisis. The struggle for control of El Fasher directly impacts the balance of power between the RSF and SAF, further destabilizing Sudan and complicating regional peace efforts."
