    "summary": "Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy cited the presence of Chinese military equipment on the battlefield as evidence of Russia's disinterest in a genuine peace agreement. Though Zelenskyy did not directly implicate Beijing's military in the supply, this development further strains international perceptions of China's neutrality regarding the war in Ukraine. The use of Chinese-made equipment raises questions about the extent of Beijing's indirect support for Moscow and the implications for future diplomatic efforts aimed at resolving the conflict. This comes as peace negotiations are reportedly stalled due to differing objectives between Kyiv and Moscow."
