Rubio's warning underscores concerns that such a move by Israel would jeopardize the U.S. Secretary of State's plan to resolve the ongoing conflict in Gaza. The potential annexation, driven by elements within the Israeli government, threatens to further destabilize the region and undermine efforts to achieve a lasting peace between Israel and Palestine. This situation occurs within the context of already heightened tensions and ongoing diplomatic efforts to de-escalate violence and establish a framework for future negotiations. The U.S. government, under the leadership of the Secretary of State, attempts to mediate a resolution, but annexation poses a significant obstacle to these efforts.",
