    "source": "NYT",
    "summary": "The Trump peace plan proposes an international security force for Gaza, aiming to stabilize the region, but faces significant obstacles. Potential troop-contributing nations express hesitation due to security risks, an undefined mission mandate, and concerns about being perceived as occupiers by the Palestinian population. This reluctance undermines the plan's implementation, highlighting the challenges in securing international buy-in for security arrangements in the complex Israeli-Palestinian conflict. Ultimately, the success of any peace initiative hinges on addressing these concerns and gaining support from key international actors."
