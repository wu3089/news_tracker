    "summary": "At a meeting in Belgium, allied nations reaffirmed their commitment to supporting Ukraine, pledging billions more in military aid, underscoring the ongoing international backing for Kyiv's defense. This commitment, involving key players from across Europe and beyond, follows continued Russian aggression and highlights the West's resolve. The increased aid, while critical for Ukraine's military capabilities, also reflects growing skepticism among supporting nations regarding Moscow's willingness to negotiate a peaceful resolution to the conflict. The context for this renewed support lies in the protracted war and the persistent failure of diplomatic efforts to achieve a ceasefire."
