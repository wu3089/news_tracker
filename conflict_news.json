    "summary": "Israeli Minister Israel Katz indicated Israel's intention to expand its territorial control in Gaza, stating that significant portions of the enclave will be incorporated into military-controlled security zones. This announcement signals a potential shift in the Israeli military strategy following the conflict and raises concerns about the long-term viability of a two-state solution. Katz's pronouncements suggest Israel's government, and potentially other key players within the ruling coalition, are considering a sustained presence in Gaza beyond current operations. This statement follows increasing international pressure for a ceasefire and renewed negotiations toward a lasting peace agreement."
