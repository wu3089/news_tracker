    "summary": "Amidst Israel's ongoing military operations in Gaza, a growing number of Israeli soldiers, alongside pressure from their families, increasingly refuse to return to service. This rise in refusal, particularly among reservists, presents a challenge to the Israeli military's operational capabilities and reflects deepening societal divisions regarding the war. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu faces mounting pressure as the Israel-Hamas war continues, revealing the dilemmas of sustaining military operations with potentially diminishing domestic support. The conflict's duration and intensity contribute to the reservists' reluctance, raising questions about Israel's long-term strategy in Gaza and its broader regional implications."
