    "summary": "In a significant legal setback, decorated Australian soldier Ben Roberts-Smith lost his appeal in a defamation case, upholding the initial ruling that found him guilty of war crimes. The case, which involved allegations of unlawful killings in Afghanistan, was brought against Roberts-Smith by media outlets that had published reports detailing the alleged misconduct.  Roberts-Smith, a highly decorated former special forces soldier, maintains his innocence and now intends to appeal the decision to the High Court. The legal proceedings have brought considerable attention to the conduct of Australian forces in Afghanistan and the standards by which military personnel are held accountable.",
