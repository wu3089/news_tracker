    "summary": "Following nearly two years of conflict, U.S. President Donald Trump directed Israel to cease bombing Gaza after Hamas accepted parts of Trump's proposed peace plan. Hamas's partial acceptance offered a potential pathway to ending the ongoing war that began with the October 7, 2023, attack and securing the release of remaining hostages. This move by the U.S. president represents a significant intervention in the conflict between Israel and Hamas and aims to de-escalate tensions in the region. The development occurs amid the broader context of sustained fighting and diplomatic efforts to resolve the long-standing Israeli-Palestinian conflict."
