The renewed power grab, likely driven by political maneuvers, threatens to undermine the sense of shared purpose that emerged during the conflict. The outcome of this internal struggle will have significant ramifications for Israel's future governance and its ability to address external threats, including the ongoing conflict with Hamas."
