    "summary": "Russia and China currently lead the global race to develop hypersonic missiles, prompting concerns about a potential shift in military capabilities. The United States is actively working to catch up in this advanced weapons technology, while the United Kingdom currently possesses no hypersonic missile program. This disparity raises questions about the strategic balance and the West's ability to deter or respond to potential threats. As hypersonic weapons development accelerates, nations face pressure to innovate and modernize their arsenals in response to perceived vulnerabilities. The rapid advancements in hypersonic missile technology could reshape international security dynamics and escalate existing geopolitical tensions.",
