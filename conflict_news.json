    "summary": "Hamas demands assurances of a permanent ceasefire in Gaza as a precondition for further hostage negotiations with Israel. This stance reflects Hamas's prioritization of territorial control and the cessation of hostilities over prisoner release, potentially complicating efforts by mediators like Egypt and Qatar to reach a comprehensive agreement. Failure to secure this guarantee could prolong the conflict, impacting regional stability and further exacerbating the humanitarian crisis in Gaza. The Israeli government, led by Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, has not yet publicly commented on whether they will give a guarantee of a permanent end to the Gaza war."
