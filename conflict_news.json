    "summary": "A suspect attacked a mall in Boulder, Colorado, injuring eight people while shouting \"free Palestine,\" prompting an FBI investigation into a suspected terror attack. The suspect employed a makeshift flamethrower during the assault, raising concerns about domestic extremism and potential links to broader geopolitical tensions related to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. Law enforcement responded to the scene, and the investigation is ongoing to determine the suspect's motives and affiliations. This incident highlights the increasing polarization of political discourse and the potential for ideologically motivated violence within the United States.",
