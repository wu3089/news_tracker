    "date_str": "November 05, 2025",
    "source": "NYT",
    "summary": "Venezuela possesses Russian weaponry and armed civilian groups, which suggests a potential for guerrilla warfare; however, these factors do not necessarily indicate an imminent coup against President Nicolás Maduro. Nicolás Maduro's regime controls these resources and maintains a grip on power, despite internal tensions. The presence of Russian arms in Venezuela underscores the ongoing geopolitical competition in the region, while the armed civilian cells highlight the government's reliance on non-state actors. These elements increase the complexity of the security landscape."
