    "summary": "European allies urge President Trump to ensure Ukraine participates in any upcoming talks with Russian President Putin at the Alaska summit. President Zelensky insists that any agreement reached without Ukraine's involvement would be a \"dead decision,\" highlighting Kyiv's concern over potential compromises that could undermine its sovereignty. The White House indicates Trump is open to Ukraine joining the talks. These developments occur against the backdrop of the ongoing war in Ukraine and underscore the divergent perspectives among key international actors regarding the conflict's resolution. The insistence on Ukraine's inclusion reflects a broader effort by European nations to maintain a unified front against Russian aggression and ensure Kyiv's interests are represented in any negotiation process.",

The conflict, rooted in long-standing tensions between Israel and Hamas in Gaza, continues to fuel regional instability and humanitarian concerns.",
