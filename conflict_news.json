    "summary": "Israeli Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich approved plans for 3,401 new homes in the E1 area of the occupied West Bank, a move he believes will undermine the possibility of a future Palestinian state. The E1 project, long considered controversial, aims to expand Israeli settlements and would effectively sever East Jerusalem from the rest of the West Bank. This action occurs against the backdrop of ongoing tensions between Israelis and Palestinians, with the expansion of settlements remaining a key point of contention and international condemnation. The international community views these settlements as illegal under international law, further complicating efforts toward a two-state solution.",
