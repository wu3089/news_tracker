    "summary": "Ukraine is concerned that Russia will attempt to sway President Trump during upcoming U.S.-Russian discussions in Alaska by portraying Ukraine as the primary impediment to resolving the conflict. This maneuver aims to shift blame away from the Kremlin and potentially influence U.S. policy toward the region, particularly as the Trump administration has at times signaled a willingness to improve relations with Moscow. This occurs amidst ongoing tensions between Ukraine and Russia following Russia's annexation of Crimea and support for separatists in eastern Ukraine. Ultimately, the success of this effort by Russia could have significant consequences for Ukraine's sovereignty and geopolitical alignment."
