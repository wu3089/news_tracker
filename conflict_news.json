    "date_str": "March 16, 2025",
    "source": "NYT",
    "summary": "Israel is increasingly integrating ultra-Orthodox Jews into its armed forces, a move driven by both military manpower needs and a desire to foster greater social cohesion. This initiative, spearheaded by the Israeli government and supported by some segments of the ultra-Orthodox community, seeks to address longstanding exemptions from mandatory conscription traditionally granted to yeshiva students. While the IDF hopes to enhance its recruitment pool and broaden the experiences of its soldiers, this policy faces opposition from other ultra-Orthodox factions who view military service as a threat to their religious way of life. The success of this integration effort will likely shape the future of civil-military relations and the broader social landscape within Israel."
