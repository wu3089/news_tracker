    "summary": "The lack of nuclear negotiations and oversight in Iran raises serious concerns about the country's nuclear material stockpile, exacerbating regional tensions and increasing the risk of military conflict. This situation develops against a backdrop of strained relations between Iran and Israel, where mutual distrust and security concerns fuel escalating rhetoric and proxy conflicts. Israel views Iran's nuclear program as an existential threat and has previously conducted military operations to hinder it. Without diplomatic engagement or a verifiable monitoring system, the potential for miscalculation or escalation rises, leading many regional actors to believe another war between Israel and Iran appears increasingly unavoidable."
