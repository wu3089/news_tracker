    "summary": "Following the ongoing conflict, Israel plans to maintain \"security zones\" within Gaza, as stated by Israeli Minister Israel Katz, signifying a continued military presence in the territory. This decision, which includes a six-week blockade of all supplies to Gaza, disregards warnings from the United Nations regarding \"devastating\" humanitarian consequences. The move underscores Israel's commitment to controlling the area post-conflict and potentially intensifies the existing humanitarian crisis. The key players involved are Israel, represented by Minister Katz, and the UN, which has expressed concerns about the blockade's impact.",
