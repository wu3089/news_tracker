    "source": "BBC",
    "pub_date": "Fri, 17 Oct 2025 13:24:24 GMT",
    "summary": "The BBC reports that the United States is considering sending Tomahawk cruise missiles to Ukraine, a move that could significantly alter the dynamics of the conflict with Russia. These long-range, precision-guided weapons would enable Ukraine to strike Russian targets far behind the front lines, potentially disrupting supply chains and military infrastructure. While the US government has not yet confirmed the decision, analysts suggest that providing Tomahawks could escalate the conflict and prompt a strong response from Russia, while also enhancing Ukraine's defensive capabilities. The debate highlights the ongoing tensions between supporting Ukraine and avoiding a direct confrontation between the US and Russia.",
