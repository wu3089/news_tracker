    "text": "With diplomatic efforts to reach a cease-fire appearing remote, and President Trump apparently abandoning the process, Russia has been escalating its assaults on Ukrainian cities and on the battlefield.",
    "link": "https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/26/world/europe/russia-ukraine-war-new-phase.html",
    "date_str": "May 26, 2025",
    "source": "NYT",
    "summary": "As diplomatic cease-fire efforts falter and the U.S., under President Trump, seemingly withdraws from mediation, Russia intensifies its military campaign against Ukrainian cities and forces, exacerbating the conflict. This escalation signals a potential shift in the war's trajectory, diminishing prospects for near-term de-escalation through negotiated settlements. Russia's intensified aggression occurs against the backdrop of stalled diplomatic negotiations, raising concerns about the future of Ukraine's sovereignty and regional stability. The diminished U.S. role further emboldens Russia and increases the vulnerability of Ukraine."
