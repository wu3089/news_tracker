The militias' actions are a direct response to the Syrian government's attempts to disarm independent groups, potentially highlighting ongoing tensions between the Druze community and the central government. This struggle occurs within the wider context of Syria's continuing civil conflict and the regime's ongoing efforts to stabilize its territory following years of fighting."
