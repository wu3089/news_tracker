    "title": "Putin Agreed to Halt Ukraine Energy Attacks During Trump Call, But No Full Ceasefire Was Reached",
    "link": "https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cd65pz1p7d9o",
    "source": "BBC",
    "pub_date": "Wed, 19 Mar 2025 04:50:58 GMT",
    "summary": "In a recent phone call, Russian President Vladimir Putin agreed to pause attacks on Ukraine's energy infrastructure, following a call with former U.S. President Donald Trump, but declined to agree to a full ceasefire. This is significant as Ukraine had previously accepted a proposed month-long ceasefire plan, which would have represented a substantial step towards de-escalation. Key players involved include Putin, Trump, and implicitly, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, who accepted the ceasefire plan. This development occurs amidst the ongoing conflict in Ukraine and highlights the continued diplomatic efforts, even if unsuccessful in securing a comprehensive peace agreement.",

    "source": "BBC",
    "pub_date": "Tue, 18 Mar 2025 12:39:37 GMT",
    "summary": "In response to heightened security concerns stemming from Russia's ongoing aggression, Poland and the Baltic states of Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania have jointly decided to withdraw from the international treaty banning landmines. This significant move, according to a joint statement, is driven by the need to provide their troops with the flexibility necessary to defend NATO's eastern flank effectively, implying a strategic reassessment of defensive capabilities in the face of potential threats. The decision highlights a tangible consequence of the conflict in Ukraine, as these nations prioritize their territorial defense posture by potentially introducing landmines to their borders. This action underscores the growing anxieties within the region regarding Russia's intentions and the perceived inadequacy of current security frameworks.",

The main players are the Israeli citizens protesting, and the current Israeli government, whose actions are spurring the demonstrations. This unrest is occurring amidst ongoing tensions in the region and internal debates about the balance of power within the Israeli state."
