    "summary": "Ukrainian President Zelenskyy has declared his willingness to meet with Russian President Putin in Turkey, signaling a potential opening for direct dialogue amid the ongoing conflict. However, Zelenskyy has conditioned these talks on an immediate ceasefire, suggesting his administration prioritizes a cessation of hostilities as a prerequisite for substantive negotiations. This call for a truce, coupled with a willingness to engage in diplomacy, highlights the complex political dynamics surrounding the war and Ukraine's desire to both de-escalate the fighting and secure favorable terms. The involvement of Turkey, as a potential venue for a summit, also indicates the importance of regional actors and their possible mediating roles in this international crisis."
