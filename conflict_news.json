    "summary": "Russia escalated its military campaign in Ukraine by launching the most significant wave of strikes in weeks, according to Ukrainian officials. These attacks, attributed to Russian forces, involved a combination of drones, hypersonic, ballistic, and cruise missiles, marking a notable intensification of the conflict. The Ukrainian government faces increased pressure to defend its territory and protect its citizens amidst the ongoing war with Russia, which has broader implications for regional stability and international relations. This recent escalation underscores the continued reliance on aerial attacks and the devastating impact on Ukrainian infrastructure.",
