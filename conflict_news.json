    "summary": "Following his involvement in student-led protests at Columbia University last spring regarding the war in Gaza, Mahmoud Khalil, a U.S. green card holder, is facing potential deportation by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE). The protests, and Khalil's role in leading them, have placed him under scrutiny by the U.S. government, with former President Donald Trump's rhetoric on immigration potentially influencing the situation.  Khalil's case highlights the intersection of immigration enforcement, political activism, and the ongoing debate surrounding the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, raising concerns about free speech and due process."

    "text": "At the worldâ€™s largest refugee camp, for Rohingya people in Bangladesh, the food allowance per person is set to fall to just $6 per month, far below what aid officials say is required for survival.",
    "link": "https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/14/world/asia/trump-aid-cuts-refugees-rohingya.html",
    "date_str": "March 14, 2025",
    "source": "NYT",
    "summary": "The World Food Programme (WFP) is drastically cutting monthly food allowances for Rohingya refugees in Bangladesh's largest camp to a mere $6 per person, significantly below the minimum survival level as determined by aid officials. This reduction stems from a critical funding shortfall, threatening the food security of the approximately one million Rohingya refugees who fled persecution in Myanmar and sought refuge in Bangladesh. The WFP, the primary provider of food assistance in the camp, is the key actor facing the difficult decision of prioritizing limited resources, while Bangladesh continues to host the vast majority of Rohingya refugees, underscoring its important role in the crisis. This decision underscores the persistent humanitarian challenges associated with the protracted Rohingya refugee crisis, the funding fatigue among international donors, and the increasing vulnerability of a population already grappling with displacement and limited resources."

This case serves as a crucial reminder of the enduring impact of the conflict and the importance of prosecuting those responsible for violations of international law."
