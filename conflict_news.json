    "summary": "The lack of negotiations and oversight regarding Iran's nuclear program intensifies regional anxieties about a potential military conflict with Israel. This absence of transparency surrounding Iran's nuclear material stockpile heightens concerns among regional actors. Israel, fearing a nuclear-armed Iran, could initiate preemptive strikes given the stalled diplomatic efforts and lack of international monitoring. The deterioration of the 2015 nuclear deal, coupled with escalating regional tensions, creates a precarious environment where miscalculation could trigger wider hostilities."
