While the full scope of the article is unknown, the central issue appears to be about the abuse of power and the unequal treatment of women in the workplace. The key players involved are implied to be male supervisors and their female employees, and perhaps the entities working to combat this behavior. This issue likely reflects broader societal challenges regarding gender dynamics, patriarchal norms, and the persistent struggles for gender equality in India's workforce, and is of critical importance to human rights."
