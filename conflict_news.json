    "summary": "In Donetsk, Russia employs swarms of fiber optic drones, giving them a tactical advantage as Ukraine defends towns along the front lines. These drones, controlled via a physical fiber optic cable, offer real-time video and precise targeting, enabling Russia to strike Ukrainian positions with greater accuracy. The BBC reports on the ground, highlighting how this technology shifts the balance of power in specific areas. As the conflict evolves, the introduction of fiber optic drones underscores the ongoing technological innovation and adaptation on both sides of the Russia-Ukraine war, potentially influencing future military strategies and defense measures.",
