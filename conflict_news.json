    "summary": "In response to sanctions imposed by the Trump administration aimed at pressuring Russia toward a ceasefire in Ukraine, Lukoil, a Russian oil company, plans to sell its international assets. This strategic decision by Lukoil signifies the tangible economic impact of U.S. sanctions on Russian entities with international operations. These sanctions, a key tool in the U.S. foreign policy arsenal, seek to modify Russia's behavior in the ongoing conflict in Ukraine. The sale may affect energy markets and geopolitical dynamics in regions where Lukoil operates, potentially opening opportunities for other actors."
