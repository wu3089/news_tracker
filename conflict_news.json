    "source": "NYT",
    "summary": "Israeli Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich has declared the elimination of Hamas's control over Gaza as the paramount objective, overshadowing other considerations. This statement, emanating from a prominent figure within Israel's far-right government, underscores the ongoing strategic prioritization of degrading Hamas's military and political capabilities following the October 7th attacks. Smotrich's stance reflects the broader Israeli perspective that eradicating Hamas's influence is essential for regional security and sets a clear political objective for any future actions in the Gaza Strip. His position is also a key aspect in the Israeli government's decision-making process."
